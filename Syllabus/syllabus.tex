\qOne{Do I need to know machine learning?}
\aOne{No. The essential tools of machine learning will be introduced in the course. However, some familiarity with linear algebra can be helpful.}

\qTwo{Do I need to know Python programming?}
\aTwo{While it is not strictly necessary, it is recommended to know at least the basic structures of the language. Several labs will use Python programs and you will be asked to execute them. }

\qThree{Do I need to know Max programming?}
\aThree{No. All Max-based labs will use ready-to-use programs with a graphical interface.}

\qFour{How much musical knowledge is required?}
\aFour{Nothing more than an intuitive understanding of concepts such as melody or timbre. The motivation of the course, however, is to produce tools to create and transform sound so you should be at least interested in this.}

%	 OVERVIEW
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Overview}

 The advancements in machine learning, especially the recent breakthrough of artificial neural networks, promoted novel art practices in which computers play a fundamental role and fostered research in the field of computational creativity. Alongside other arts, music has also benefited from the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence for tasks ranging from music generation to music analysis and composition.

 \textbf{Music 30} (\emph{Computational creativity for music and the arts}) aims at exploring the potential that computers have to support, enhance and challenge music creation. The course is divided into three modules. The first module introduces the essential mathematical and machine learning tools and gives a general introduction to sound. The second module shows real applications of creative computing for music. The third module focuses on the connection between the society and computational creativity at large.
Classes are supported by labs based  on state-of-the-art computational tools.

\section{Assignments, Exams and Make-up Policy}

Assignments will be given after each lab and they must be turned in before the next lab. They may include small closed-answer questions to be done on \emph{bCourses} and hands-on projects. There will also be a midterm  and a final, both designed as essay-based take-home exams to be written over a 24-hour period. Assignments and exams must be done individually by each student.

Make-up exams or assignments will only be allowed for students who have a substantiated excuse approved by the instructor \emph{before the due date}. Leaving a phone message or sending an e-mail without confirmation is not acceptable. Labs are mandatory.

\section{Cheating and Plagiarism}

Anyone caught cheating on a quiz or exam in this course will receive a failing grade in the course and will also be reported to the University Center for Student Conduct.

To copy text or ideas from another source without appropriate reference is plagiarism and will result in a failing grade for your assignment and usually further disciplinary action. For additional information on plagiarism and how to avoid it, see, for
example: \url{http://gsi.berkeley.edu/teachingguide/misconduct/prevent-plag.html}.

\section{Emergency procedures (McEnerney Hall)}

Your emergency evacuation assembly area is the steps directly across Arch St. leading to the Pacific School of Religion.
In the event of an emergency please follow instructions from your instructor and CNMAT staff.
Take note of emergency procedures posted in your classroom. If the fire alarm is sounding, exit the building immediately. In the event of an earthquake, duck when possible and hold in place, covering your head with your arms, a binder or your laptop. Then exit the building when the shaking stops.

EMERGENCY SERVICES:
\begin{itemize}
\item UC Police and all emergencies number from campus phones: 911
\item UC Police and all emergencies number from cell phones: (510) 642-3333
\item UC Police non-emergency number: (510) 642-6760
\end{itemize}
