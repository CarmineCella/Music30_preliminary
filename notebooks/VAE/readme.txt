Parting thoughts:
- I wanted to take a look longer at reconstruction + generation, since librosa.griffinlim 
wasn't working well on the encoded+decoded test files.
- I tried making the network larger (changing the dimensions and adding layers) but my computer
kept running out of memory. Wasn't sure what to do at that point.
